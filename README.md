## Project Description
- Basic iOS Tetris game.
- You need to use buttons on the screen to direct upcoming shape.
- Objective C is used for the project.
- StackOverFlow, Udemy courses and many other small web source used to implement.
- Technologies: 
	- Objective C
	- XCode 10.1 Build Version: 10B61
- Main idea of the project is learning and adopting mobile environment and playgrounds.

- I am still struggling to handle Objective C's weirdness. Most things I did have no idea how it works.
- I am not sure but next project may be Cross-Platform coding (Like Kivy/Python)
